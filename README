* How to install

1. Rename directory name to .emacs.d (make necessary backups)
2. In .emacs.d, run: ./install

* About patches

The directory patch/ contains patches that are tailored for my own preference
(key bindings, color, etc). If you don't want to apply these patches, just set
the 'doPatch' variable to anything else except 'y' in the install script.
